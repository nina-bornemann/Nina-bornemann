# 👋 Hi, I’m Nina

🌱 I’m currently taking part in a Bootcamp to become a full-stack developer. Coming from a background in Biochemistry (M.Sc.) and working in research, I shifted into software engineering to build tools that are clean, practical, and impactful.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React | HTML | CSS
- **Backend:** Spring Boot | REST APIs | Node.js
- **Databases:** MySQL | MongoDB | PostgreSQL
- **Tools & Others:** Git | Docker | Maven | Vite | JUnit

## 🚀 Key Projects
🔹 [Asterix API](https://github.com/nina-bornemann/Spring_Data_AsterixAPI)
